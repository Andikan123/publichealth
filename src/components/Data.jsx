      ANA (1980)
    </h3>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      Agrees that the type of involvement previously described is a synthesis of nursing practice and public health practice.
    </p>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      What ANA called Community Health Nurse, the APHA called Public Health Nurse.
    </p>
  
    <h4 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>
      In 1984, ANA and APHA participants aimed to clarify the educational preparation needed for public health nursing and to discuss the future of public health nursing.
    </h4>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      It was agreed that the term <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>"Community Health Nurse"</span> is an umbrella term used for all nurses who work in a community, including those who have formal preparation in public health nursing.
    </p>
  
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      In essence, public health nursing requires specific educational preparation, and community health nursing denotes a setting for the practice of nursing.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>
      Public Health Nursing Educational Program Should Include:
    </h3>
    <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      <li>Epidemiology, statistics, and research</li>
      <li>Orientation to health care systems</li>

      <li>Application of public health concepts to the care of groups of culturally diverse persons</li>

      <li>Orientation to regulations affecting public health nursing practice</li>

    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      This educational preparation is assumed to be complementary to basic educational nursing.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>
      Community Health Nurse
    </h3>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      A registered nurse who works in a non-institutional setting and has either received a diploma or completed an associate degree nursing education program can be called a community health nurse and practice community-based nursing because he/she works outside the hospital and nursing home.
    </p>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      However, this nurse wouldn’t have had any formal education in public health nursing. Such a nurse may provide care directed at individuals or families, rather than populations.

    <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>
      Public Health Nurse
    </h3>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      Public health nurses provide population-focused care. Assessment, planning, and evaluation occur at the population level.
    </p>
    <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
      However, implementation of health care programs and services may occur at the level of individuals, families, groups, communities, and systems.

  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    3. Promoting health for individuals and supporting families related to developmental stages (pregnancy, labor and delivery, care of newborns, care of dependent family members, care of dependent elderly, care of the dying).

    Distinguishing Features of Community Public Health Nurse:
  </h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    CPHNs are expected to use the nursing process in their relations with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities.
  </p>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>
    Beliefs Underlying CPHN
  </h3>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Human beings have rights and responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Promoting and maintaining family independence is healthful.</li>
    <li>Environments have an impact on human health.</li>
    <li>Nurses can make a difference and promote change toward health for individuals, families, and communities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Vulnerable and at-risk populations—groups, families—need special attention, especially the aged, infants, the disabled, the ill, and the poor.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Poverty and oppression are social barriers to the achievement of health and human potential.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Interpersonal relationships are essential to caring for others.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Hygiene, self-care, and prevention are as important as care of the sick.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    CPHNs can be leaders and innovators in developing programs of nursing care and programs for adequate standards of living.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '25px' }}>
    CPHN care should be available to all, not just the poor.
  </p>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>
    Population Has Two Meanings:
  </h3>
  <ol style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>People residing in an area.</li>
    <li>A group or set of persons under statistical study.</li>
  </ol>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The word <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>group</span> here means a set or collection of people, not a system of individuals who engage in face-to-face interaction, which is the definition of group used in the discussion of systems theory.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '25px' }}>
    Using this definition, a population is a set of people having a common characteristic that might relate to health, such as age, race, sex, social class, medical diagnosis, level of disability, exposure to a toxin, or participation in health-seeking behavior (e.g., smoking cessation).
  </p>
</div>

<div style={{ fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif', lineHeight: 1.6, color: '#333', margin: '20px' }}>
  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8' }}>Risk</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Risk is a statistical concept based on probability. C/PH Nursing is concerned with human risk of disease, disability, and premature death.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Therefore, C/PHN work with persons within the population to reduce their risk for developing a health condition.
  </p>

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>Aggregate</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Aggregate is a synonym for the second definition of population. Aggregates are people who do not have the relatedness necessary to constitute an interpersonal group (system) but who have one or more characteristics in common, such as pregnant teenagers.
  </p>

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>Prevention</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Prevention is a complex concept that evolved from an attempt to control disease among the public. Epidemiology is a science that helps to describe the natural history of specific diseases, including:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Presymptomatic period</li>
    <li>Symptomatic period</li>
    <li>Resolution (death, disability, complication, or recovery)</li>
  </ul>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The broad concept of prevention has three levels:
  </p>
  <ol style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Primary level prevention</li>
    <li>Secondary level prevention</li>
    <li>Tertiary level prevention</li>
  </ol>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    All levels of prevention can be accomplished through work with:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Individuals</li>
    <li>Groups</li>
    <li>Families</li>
    <li>Communities (law, social mores)</li>
    <li>Changes in the physical environment (e.g., waste disposal)</li>
  </ul>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '25px' }}>
    The well-being and health of the entire population within the community is the ultimate goal of public health.
  </p>

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>Three Primary Functions of Public Health</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The various roles and settings for practice hinge on three primary functions of public health: 
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Assessment</li>
    <li>Policy Development</li>
    <li>Assurance</li>
  </ul>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '25px' }}>
    These functions are foundational to all roles assumed by the community health nurse and are applied at three levels of service:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>To individuals</li>
    <li>To families</li>
    <li>To communities</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>Assessment</h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    An essential first function in public health, the community health nurse must gather and analyze information that will affect the health of the people to be served:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Health needs</li>
    <li>Health risks</li>
    <li>Environmental conditions</li>
    <li>Political agendas</li>
    <li>Financial and other resources</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>Policy Development</h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Policy development is enhanced by the synthesis and analysis of information obtained during assessment. At the community level, the nurse provides leadership in convening and facilitating community groups to evaluate health concerns and develop a plan to address them.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '25px' }}>
    Typically, the nurse recommends specific training and programs to meet the identified health needs of target populations.
  </p>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>Assurance</h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Assurance activities—activities that make certain that services are provided—often consume most of the community health nurse’s time. Community health nurses perform the assurance function at the community level when they:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Provide service to target populations</li>
    <li>Improve quality assurance activities</li>
    <li>Maintain safe levels of communicable disease surveillance and outbreak control</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style={{ fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif', lineHeight: 1.6, color: '#333', margin: '20px' }}>
  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8' }}>Standards for Community Nursing</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Individuals should receive nursing services based on standards developed by the American Nurses Association (ANA), such as:

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>Clinician Role</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The most familiar role of the community health nurse is that of clinician or care provider. This means that the nurse ensures that health services are provided not just to individuals and families, but also to groups and populations.
  </p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Three clinician emphases, in particular, are useful to consider here:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Holism</li>
    <li>Health promotion</li>
    <li>Skill expansion</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>Holistic Practice</h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    In community health, a holistic approach means considering the broad range of interacting needs that affect the collective health of the “client” as a larger system. Holistic nursing care encompasses the comprehensive and total care of the client in all areas, such as physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and economic.
  </p>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>Health Promotion</h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The clinician role in community health is characterized by its focus on promoting wellness. Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Immunization of preschoolers</li>
    <li>Family planning programs</li>
    <li>Cholesterol screening</li>
    <li>Prevention of behavioral problems in adolescents</li>
  </ul>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Protecting and promoting the health of vulnerable populations is an important component of the clinician role.
  </p>

  <h3 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '30px' }}>Expanded Skills</h3>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    With time, skills in observation, listening, communication, and counseling became integral to the clinician role as it grew to encompass an increased emphasis on psychological and sociocultural factors. Recently, environmental and community-wide considerations, such as problems caused by:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Pollution</li>
    <li>Violence and crime</li>
    <li>Drug abuse</li>
    <li>Unemployment, poverty, homelessness</li>
    <li>Limited funding for health programs</li>
  </ul>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    These challenges have created a need for stronger skills in assessing the needs of groups and populations and intervening at the community level.
  </p>

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>Role of the Public Health Nurse</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Public health nurses have several important roles, including:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Provide input to interdisciplinary programs that monitor, anticipate, and respond to health problems in population groups for all diseases or public health threats, including bioterrorism.</li>
    <li>Evaluate health trends and risk factors of population groups to help determine priorities forming targeted interventions.</li>
    <li>Work with the community or specific population groups to develop targeted health promotion and disease prevention activities.</li>
    <li>Evaluate health care services.</li>
    <li>Provide health education, care, management, and primary care to individuals and families who are members of vulnerable populations and high-risk groups.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Public health nurses integrate community involvement and knowledge of the entire population with the personal clinical understandings of health and illness gleaned from the experiences of individuals and families within the population.
  </p>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The nurse working in public health should be a voice for members of the community to voice problems and desires. They also articulate and translate health and illness experiences of diverse, often vulnerable, individuals and families to the health planners and policy makers.
  </p>

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>Standards of Practice</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    Standards of practice have been established by the American Nurses Association.
  </p>

  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a73e8', marginTop: '30px' }}>What is the Quad Council?</h2>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The Quad Council Coalition (QCC) of Public Health Nursing Organizations is comprised of the following organizations:
  </p>
  <ul style={{ fontSize: '18px', listStyleType: 'disc', marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    <li>Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (AHNE)</li>
    <li>Association of Community Health Nursing Educators (ACHNE)</li>
    <li>Association of Public Health Nurses (APHN)</li>
    <li>American Public Health Association Public Health Nursing Section</li>
  </ul>

  <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
    The specialist-level competencies require preparation at the Master’s level in community and/or public health nursing.
